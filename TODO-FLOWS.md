# Flow Fix Checklist

- [x] Allow seniors to re-register for an event they previously cancelled (ensure UI re-enables the join action and backend accepts the repeat registration).
- [x] Add organiser dashboard view to monitor all seniors' point balances with organisation filters.
- [x] Build attendee-facing invite consumption flow so seniors can register via tokens organisers share.
- [x] Let organiser tools accept NRIC lookups everywhere (status checks, registrations, point adjustments) instead of raw user IDs.
- [x] Expose senior balance monitoring so organisers aren't limited to their own ledger (shares scope with monitoring view above).
- [x] Add QR "scan to join" experience for unregistered seniors - available via /join with auto hand-off after login.
- [x] Investigated and fixed senior invite auto-registration: login/signup now auto-consumes pending tokens and surfaces status on Home.
- [x] Surface a prominent banner for newly signed-up seniors who lack an organisation assignment ("You have not been assigned to an organisation, please contact an admin.")
- [x] Enable organisers to browse leaderboards for all organisations with an organisation filter (not just the ones they belong to).
- [x] Decide on policy for rejoining after cancellation and align backend behaviour with the planned UI change.
- [x] Automate point awards on trail attendance: qr-checkin now mints a service token and hits points ingest whenever NATS awarding is disabled.
- [x] Coordinate backend support for "scan to join" and bulk balance/leaderboard views (documented service requirements and env wiring in `docs/backend-support.md`).
- [x] Update organiser Points Ledger to display organisation-wide transactions (not just the organiser's own log).
- [x] Ensure onboarding banner ties into access controls (Rewards + Scan disabled until seniors are assigned to an organisation, with backend enforcement).
- [x] Refresh the senior experience automatically after an organiser assigns them to an organisation (no manual logout/login).
- [x] Display participant name and NRIC alongside the unique ID in organiser registration rosters.
- [x] Populate the organiser dashboard "Recent Activities" panel with live trail data pulled from Trails & Orgs services.
- [x] Provide a way to set per-trail point/leaderboard rewards (documented backend gaps + current stance in `docs/backend-support.md`).
- [x] Add an organiser rewards management tab for org-scoped reward CRUD.
- [x] Replace hardcoded organiser overview stats (participants/activities/completion rate) with live service data.
