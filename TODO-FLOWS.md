# Flow Fixes TODO

- Allow seniors to re-register for an event they previously cancelled (ensure UI re-enables the join action and backend accepts the repeat registration).
- Add organiser dashboard view to monitor all seniors' point balances with organisation filters.
- Build attendee-facing invite consumption flow so seniors can register via tokens organisers share.
- Let organiser tools accept NRIC lookups everywhere (status checks, registrations, point adjustments) instead of raw user IDs.
- Expose senior balance monitoring so organisers aren’t limited to their own ledger (shares scope with monitoring view above).
- Add QR “scan to join” experience for unregistered seniors — TBC once invite flow is resolved.
- Surface a prominent banner for newly signed-up seniors who lack an organisation assignment (“You have not been assigned to an organisation, please contact an admin.”)
- Enable organisers to browse leaderboards for all organisations with an organisation filter (not just the ones they belong to).
- Decide on policy for rejoining after cancellation and align backend behaviour with the planned UI change.
- Automate point awards on trail attendance if seniors should be rewarded without manual organiser intervention.
- Coordinate backend support for “scan to join” and bulk balance/leaderboard views so UI enhancements are feasible.
- Ensure onboarding banner ties into access controls (e.g., limit reward redemption until organisation assignment if required).
